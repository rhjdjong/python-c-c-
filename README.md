# Python-C-CPP

This repository contains examples for using C and C++ libraries from Python,
and on using Python code (callbacks or arbitrary scripts) from C and C++.

Each directory illustrates a particular scenario,
and has both a C or C++ executable (called `main`)
and a Python script (called `demo.py`)
that demonstrate the usage of the scenario.

## 1. Basic C library used in Python

A `greeting` library that contains a function that prints a message.

## 2. Python callback from C library

Similar to the previous example, but in this case the printing is done
via a callback function.
